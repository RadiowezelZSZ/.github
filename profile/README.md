Welcome to RadiowezelZSZ, where we're revolutionizing how music brings your school community together! We believe that great moments at school deserve a great soundtrack, and who better to create that soundtrack than the students themselves?

## 💫 Our Vision
Remember those moments between classes when the hallways come alive with energy? We wanted to make those moments even more special by letting students become their own DJs. RadiowezelZSZ isn't just another music app – it's a platform that gives students a voice in creating their school's atmosphere.
